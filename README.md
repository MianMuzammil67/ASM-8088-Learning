# ASM Learning Repository

This repository contains various Assembly language programs written for learning purposes. The files demonstrate different concepts and techniques in Assembly programming, ranging from simple programs to more complex ones.

## Files in This Repository:

### 1. **hello1.asm**
   - A simple Assembly program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.
   - Purpose: Introduce the basic structure of an Assembly program and how to use system calls to output text.

### 2. **screen.asm**
   - This program demonstrates how to manipulate screen output in Assembly language.
   - Purpose: Show how to directly interact with the screen using Assembly instructions.

### 3. **sort01.asm**
   - An Assembly program that implements a basic sorting algorithm (such as bubble sort).
   - Purpose: Teach sorting algorithms in Assembly and demonstrate how data is manipulated in low-level programming.

### 4. **student.asm**
   - A program that checks if the sum of a series of numbers is **even** or **odd**.
   - Purpose: Demonstrate how to perform arithmetic operations and check conditions in Assembly.

### 5. **sum10num.asm**
   - This program calculates the sum of 10 numbers (could be predefined or user input).
   - Purpose: Demonstrate loops, arithmetic operations, and basic input/output in Assembly.
